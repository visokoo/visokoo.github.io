A Devops Engineer that's currently based in Seattle, WA and employed @ Avvo.

Started off in the Helpdesk field and worked my way up to where I am now. 
I'm goal-driven, scrappy, and detail-oriented. Outside of work,
I enjoy hiking, board games, snowboarding, and eating too much.

With that, I'll leave you with an obligatory PNW hiking photo.
